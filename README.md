# Project Git partner
This repo is only the frontend of my web application. The backend can be found in the "CollectorsApp" repository.

# Project Overview
This was a school project I did at the first semester of my master studies. The goal of this project was to learn ASP .NET Core and deepen my React skills.
I choose an app, that could be useful for my every day life. One of my hobbies to collect sport trading cards(mainly soccer/football), but I couldn't keep track of them. So I decided to develop a web application, where I can store information about them(picture, title, buying price, current value, etc.)

Later on I extended this with my thesis project, which is a support system for our sport bets, using data visualization and deep learning. For my thesis I developed an android app and used tensorflow lite, to make the prediction(neural network). In this project I'm using a c# backend and running the script from a python script. This is not the best solution, but it helped my learn, how I can run scripts and pass information between different programming languages. 

In the future I want to further develop this system, so that it can keep track of all my valuable belongings(crypto, stocks, other collection item, cash, etc.)

# Skills learned
React and javascript. Got a better understanding how I should seperate different components, to seperate the responsibilities correctly. 
Application programming interface: REST API -> Before this project I only used REST API in a few school labs. This helped my understand it clearer. I still need to learn more about tokenization.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
